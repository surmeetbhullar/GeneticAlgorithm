Reproduction of an experiment first conducted at Harvard University in 1968 to study the effects of evolution on a population of robots. Each robot inherited random mappings, over time the mappings evolved into successful strategies through reproduction with the top 50% (based on recorded moves) of the robot population. Implemented random map generation, reproduction of robots via natural selection, and algorithms to better navigate the maps.
